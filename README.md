# UK Hospital Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project presents an analysis of hospital data within the UK, focusing on key aspects such as hospital types, geographical distribution, sector classification (public vs. private), and organizational structures[cite: 1]. Understanding these factors is crucial for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and gaining insights into the UK's healthcare landscape[cite: 2]. The analysis employs data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to offer a comprehensive overview[cite: 3].

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

* Clean and preprocess raw hospital data for quality and consistency[cite: 4].
* Explore the distribution of hospitals by type and subtype[cite: 5].
* Visualise the geographical distribution of hospitals to identify regional patterns[cite: 6].
* Determine the split between public (NHS Sector) and private (Independent Sector) hospitals[cite: 7].
* Analyse the influence of parent organizations on hospital distribution[cite: 8].
* Assess the completeness of hospital contact information[cite: 8].
* Examine the density of hospitals across latitude and longitude coordinates[cite: 9].

## Methodology

The analysis followed a multi-stage approach:

1.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    * Tool: Python (Jupyter Notebook)[cite: 10].
    * Process: Loaded data using pandas, handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats[cite: 11, 12, 26, 27, 46]. Columns with excessive missing data ('Address3', 'Fax,,,') were dropped[cite: 45]. Missing categorical data was filled with 'Unknown', and numerical geographic coordinates were filled with the median[cite: 44, 45]. Phone and website formats were standardized[cite: 49]. The cleaned data was saved[cite: 51, 52].
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    * Tool: Python (Jupyter Notebook)[cite: 13].
    * Process: Used matplotlib and seaborn for visualisations illustrating distributions of hospital types, subtypes, sector, and geographical location[cite: 14].
3.  **Advanced Data Analysis**:
    * Tools: Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Excel[cite: 15].
    * Process: Aggregated data (e.g., hospitals per city/county), calculated percentage distributions, analysed parent organization influence[cite: 15]. Data was exported to Excel for further manipulation if needed[cite: 16].
4.  **Data Visualisation and Dashboarding**:
    * Tool: Power BI[cite: 17].
    * Process: Created interactive dashboards using key findings to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring insights[cite: 17].

## Analysis Highlights

* **Data Overview**: The dataset includes OrganisationID, Code, Type/SubType (mostly "Hospital"), Sector (NHS/Independent), Status, Name, Address details, Latitude/Longitude, Parent Organisation details, and Contact Information[cite: 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24].
* **Hospital Types**: 'Hospital' is the predominant OrganisationType and SubType, indicating a focus on general hospitals[cite: 55, 58]. 'Mental Health Hospital' is the next most common known subtype[cite: 58].
* **Geographic Distribution**: Hospitals are concentrated in certain areas, particularly southern regions, with London having significantly more hospitals than other cities[cite: 62, 66]. A heatmap visualization showed high density in specific latitude/longitude bins, likely corresponding to major metropolitan areas, and sparser distribution elsewhere[cite: 103, 107, 109, 115].
* **Sector Analysis**: The NHS Sector represents a larger proportion (61.4%) of hospitals compared to the Independent Sector (38.6%) in this dataset[cite: 69, 77].
* **Parent Organizations**: Large parent organizations like BMI Healthcare and Spire Healthcare manage a significant number of hospitals, suggesting market consolidation[cite: 82].
* **Contact Information Completeness**: Website availability was excellent (100%), phone number availability was good (~79.4%), but email address availability was poor (~34.8%)[cite: 87, 88, 89, 91]. All hospitals had at least one contact method listed[cite: 92].

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:

1.  **Address Geographic Disparities**: Prioritize resource allocation and potentially new facilities in underserved areas identified by the geographic analysis to improve healthcare access equity[cite: 117, 120].
2.  **Enhance Data Completeness**: Implement data governance policies to improve the accuracy and completeness of contact information, especially email addresses, to facilitate communication[cite: 121, 122, 124].
3.  **Strategic Service Planning**: Tailor healthcare service planning considering the prevalence of general hospitals but also the need for specialized services like mental health[cite: 125, 127, 128].
4.  **Consider Sector Balance**: Policymakers should factor in the balance and dynamics between NHS and Independent Sector hospitals in funding and provision decisions[cite: 129, 131].
5.  **Monitor Parent Organization Influence**: Regulators should monitor the impact of consolidation by large parent organizations on competition, service diversity, and patient choice[cite: 132, 134].

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the UK hospital landscape, highlighting key trends in distribution, characteristics, and organizational structures[cite: 135]. The findings can inform strategic decision-making in healthcare planning, resource allocation, and policy development[cite: 136]. The combined use of Python, Excel, and Power BI enabled efficient processing and clear presentation of results[cite: 137].
